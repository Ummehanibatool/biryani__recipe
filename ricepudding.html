<h1>rice pudding recipe</h1> 
<p>Rice pudding is made by simmering washed rice in milk over low heat until the grains soften and begin to release their starch, creating a naturally creamy texture. Typically, full-fat milk is used for richness, and the mixture is stirred often to prevent sticking. Sugar is added once the rice is nearly tender, along with a pinch of salt to balance the sweetness. As the pudding thickens, flavorings such as cardamom, vanilla, or a cinnamon stick can be added, and some variations include a handful of raisins or chopped nuts for extra texture. The pudding is cooked until it becomes silky and thick, then removed from the heat and finished with a little butter or cream for smoothness. It can be served warm or chilled, sometimes garnished with almonds, pistachios, or a sprinkle of cinnamon, making it a comforting and classic dessert.</p>
