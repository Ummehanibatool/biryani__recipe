<h1>chicken biryani recipe</h1>
<p>Chicken biryani is made by marinating chicken pieces in yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, lemon juice, salt, and a little oil for at least an hour. Meanwhile, basmati rice is soaked and then cooked in plenty of boiling water flavored with whole spices like bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon until it is about seventy percent done. To prepare the gravy, onions are fried in oil and ghee until golden brown, then tomatoes, green chilies, and the marinated chicken are added and cooked until the chicken is nearly done and the gravy thickens. Fresh mint, cilantro, and fried onions are mixed in for fragrance. The biryani is assembled by layering the chicken gravy at the bottom of a heavy pot and spreading the partially cooked rice over the top. A little ghee, more herbs, fried onions, and optionally saffron milk are sprinkled over the rice. The pot is sealed tightly and cooked on high heat for a few minutes, then on very low heat for about twenty minutes to allow the flavors to meld in a process called “dum.” After resting for a few minutes, the biryani is gently fluffed and served hot with raita or salad.</p>
