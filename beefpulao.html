<h1>beef pulao recipe</h1>
<p>Beef pulao is prepared by first boiling beef pieces (preferably with bones for richer flavor) in water along with ginger-garlic paste, salt, whole spices such as cloves, bay leaves, cinnamon, black cardamom, and peppercorns until the meat becomes tender and a flavorful stock forms. In another pot, thinly sliced onions are fried in oil or ghee until golden brown, after which green chilies and optional tomatoes are added. The cooked beef along with its stock is then poured into the pot, followed by soaked basmati rice. The spice level and seasoning are adjusted with a little garam masala, cumin, and additional salt if needed. The rice is cooked on medium heat until most of the water evaporates, then the flame is lowered, and the pulao is left to steam gently so the grains cook fully and absorb the aromatic beef broth. Once the rice turns fluffy and separate, the pulao is rested for a few minutes and served warm, garnished with fried onions or fresh coriander, accompanied by raita or a simple salad.</p>
