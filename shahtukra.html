<h1>shahi tukra recipe</h1>
<p>Shahi tukra is made by first frying slices of bread—traditionally cut into triangles or squares—in ghee until they turn crisp and golden brown. Separately, milk is simmered on low heat with sugar, cardamom, and a few saffron strands until it thickens into a rich, creamy rabri. Once the milk reduces, the fried bread pieces are either briefly soaked in a light sugar syrup or directly layered in a dish before being topped generously with the warm rabri. The dessert is then garnished with chopped nuts like almonds and pistachios, allowing the bread to absorb the fragrant, sweet milk while still maintaining a slight crispness. Shahi tukra can be served warm or chilled, offering a luxurious blend of creamy, crunchy, and aromatic flavors.</p>
